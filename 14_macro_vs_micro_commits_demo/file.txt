Realization: What did you notice about the commit history after switching from macro to micro commits?

i realize that it is more clean and readable when doing micro commits rather than macro
the reason is that to have clear and concise to track the progress what have done in history
aside from it to maintain the maintainability of project work and collaboration to other developer
